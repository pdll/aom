# Futher development

`aom` is in open beta and will be expanded with new features. Errors are not excluded, as well
as replacement and renaming of a number of functions and decorators. All requests, questions and
bug reports in the github [Issues](https://github.com/scarych/aom/issues)

In the plans:

- JSDoc documentation
- implementation of decorators for api-services in `express` (similar to` koa`)
- decorators to extend the databases functionality (`mongoose`, `typeorm`)
- development of functionality for microservices support (`kafkajs`)
- development of functionality for support `GraphQL`
- adding the ability to create multilingual OpenApi documentation
